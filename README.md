# PERT-Analysis-Advanced-Project-Scheduling-imperical-sulution-
This repository showcases a deep fusion of advanced LaTeX and professional-level project management. From intricate PERT scheduling to critical path analysis, every table, chart, and diagram here is built with surgical accuracy.

Using TikZ-based custom node diagrams, statistical variance analyses, dummy activity logic, and risk probability evaluations, this project reflects a *practical yet mathematically disciplined* approach to complex project execution.

### Highlights:
- ‚úçÔ∏è Custom-built PERT schedule and Critical Path diagrams using pure LaTeX 
- üìà Full probabilistic analysis, including variance, confidence intervals, and real-world risk assessment.
- üî• Mastered activity network logic (AOA and Node diagrams) with manual dummy activity placement for dependency mapping.
